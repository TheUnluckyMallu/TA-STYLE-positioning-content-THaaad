                    <p>In our urban and suburban houses what should we do without cats, In our sitting or bedrooms, our libraries, in our kitchens and storerooms, our farms, barns, and rickyards, in our docks, our granaries, our ships, and our wharves, in our corn markets, meat markers, and other places too numerous to mention, how useful they are! In our ships, however, the rats oft . them at defiance still they are of great service. <br><br>
                    How wonderfully patent is the cat when watching for rats or mice, awaiting their egress from their place of refuge or Nat which is their home! How well Shakespeare in Pericles, Act III., describes this keen attention of the cat to its natural pursuit!</p><br>
                        <p class="container2">The cat, in eyne of burning coal, Now crouches horn (before) the mouse, hole. .</p>
                    <p><br>A slight rustle, and the fugitive, comes forth; a quick, sharp, resolute motion, and the cat has proved its usefulness. Let any one have a plague of rats and mice, as I once had, and let them be delivered therefrom by rats, as I was, and they will have a lasting and kind regard for them.
